## Project Description

Dalali House Management System is a web-based application designed to connect property owners (sellers) directly with buyers. The system simplifies property listing, management, and purchasing by acting as a trusted middleman (Dalali) between sellers and buyers.
Users can register and log in to the system. Sellers are able to add, manage, update, and delete property listings, as well as view payment information. Buyers can browse available properties and purchase them through the platform.
Before any property is visible to buyers, it must be reviewed and approved by the system administrator (Dalali). This approval process ensures property authenticity, security, and trust within the platform.
